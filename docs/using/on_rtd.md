# Using on ReadTheDocs

This page describes how to get started with using the MyST parser for documentation generated by and hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), which "simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you".

## Example minimal setup

A `.readthedocs.yml` file with this content:

```yaml
version: 2
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py
python:
  version: 3
  install:
    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt
```

```{tip}
See [Read The Docs' configuration file documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/index.html) for more 
```

A `docs/requirements.txt` with at least this content:

```txt
myst-parser[sphinx]
```

A `docs/conf.py` file with at least this content:

```python
extensions = [
    'myst_parser',
]

source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']
```

```{tip}
Use `sphinx-quickstart` to create your `conf.py` file and make the above modifications; see [Getting Started with Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html#quick-start) for more.  Just remember that to enable markdown-formatted documentation, you're using MyST Parser *instead* of ReCommonMark.  (You still get all of CommonMark, and more!)
```

And now you're good to go, using MyST for your Sphinx-powered, ReadTheDocs-hosted documentation!
