# Using with the Sphinx Document Generator

Sphinx is a documentation generator for building a website or book from multiple source documents and assets. To get started with Sphinx, see their [Quickstart Guide](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html).

To use the MyST parser in Sphinx, simply add: `extensions = ["myst_parser"]` to your `conf.py` and all documents with the `.md` extension will be parsed as MyST.

Naturally this site is generated with Sphinx and MyST!
