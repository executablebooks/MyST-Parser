**[CommonMark compliant](commonmark-block-tokens)** ‚úî

MyST extends CommonMark with [syntax meant for scholarly writing and technical documentation](extended-block-tokens).

---
**[Extendable syntax](syntax/directives)** üöÄ

MyST provides [roles](syntax/roles) and [directives](syntax/directives), allowing you to extend MyST's functionality.

**[Compatible with Sphinx](sphinx/index.md)** üìÑ

This MyST parser is built on top of the [`markdown-it-py` package][markdown-it-py], an pluggable Python parser for Markdown.

^^^
The [Javascript parser][markdown-it-myst] builds on [markdown-it][markdown-it], and allows you to parse MyST in websites.
