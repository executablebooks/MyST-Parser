Overview
========

This notebook gives an introduction to wealth distribution dynamics, with a
focus on 

* modeling and computing the wealth distribution via simulation,

* measures of inequality such as the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient, and

* how inequality is affected by the properties of wage income and returns on assets.

The wealth distribution in many countries exhibits a Pareto tail 

* See :doc:`this lecture <heavy_tails>` for a definition.

* For a review of the empirical evidence, see, for example, :cite:`benhabib2018skewed`.



A Note on Assumptions
---------------------

The evolution of wealth for any given household depends on their
savings behavior. 

We will use the following imports.

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline
    
    import quantecon as qe
    from numba import njit, jitclass, float64, prange


Lorenz Curves and the Gini Coefficient
======================================

Before we investigate wealth dynamics, we briefly review some measures of
inequality.

Lorenz Curves
-------------

One popular graphical measure of inequality is the `Lorenz curve
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_curve>`__.

The package `QuantEcon.py <https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py>`__,
already imported above, contains a function to compute Lorenz curves.

To illustrate, suppose that 

.. code:: ipython3

    n = 10_000                      # size of sample
    w = np.exp(np.random.randn(n))  # lognormal draws

is data representing the wealth of 10,000 households.

We can compute and plot the Lorenz curve as follows:

.. code:: ipython3

    f_vals, l_vals = qe.lorenz_curve(w)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label='Lorenz curve, lognormal sample')
    ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='Lorenz curve, equality')
    ax.legend()
    plt.show()

This curve can be understood as follows: if point :math:`(x,y)` lies on the curve, it means that, collectively, the bottom :math:`(100x)\%` of the population holds :math:`(100y)\%` of the wealth.


.. code:: ipython3

    a_vals = (1, 2, 5)              # Pareto tail index 
    n = 10_000                      # size of each sample
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    for a in a_vals:
        u = np.random.uniform(size=n)
        y = u**(-1/a)               # distributed as Pareto with tail index a
        f_vals, l_vals = qe.lorenz_curve(y)
        ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$a = {a}$')
    ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
    ax.legend()
    plt.show()

You can see that, as the tail parameter of the Pareto distribution increases, inequality decreases.

This is to be expected, because a higher tail index implies less weight in the tail of the Pareto distribution.



The Gini Coefficient
--------------------

The definition and interpretation of the Gini coefficient can be found on the
corresponding `Wikipedia page
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient>`__.

A value of 0 indicates perfect equality (corresponding the case where the
Lorenz curve matches the 45 degree line) and a value of 1 indicates complete
inequality (all wealth held by the richest household).

The `QuantEcon.py <https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py>`__ library
contains a function to calculate the Gini coefficient.

We can test it on the Weibull distribution with parameter :math:`a`, where the
Gini coefficient is known to be

.. math::  G = 1 - 2^{-1/a} 

Let's see if the Gini coefficient computed from a simulated sample matches
this at each fixed value of :math:`a`.



.. code:: ipython3

    a_vals = range(1, 20)
    ginis = []
    ginis_theoretical = []
    n = 100
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    for a in a_vals:
        y = np.random.weibull(a, size=n)
        ginis.append(qe.gini_coefficient(y))
        ginis_theoretical.append(1 - 2**(-1/a))
    ax.plot(a_vals, ginis, label='estimated gini coefficient')
    ax.plot(a_vals, ginis_theoretical, label='theoretical gini coefficient')
    ax.legend()
    ax.set_xlabel("Weibull parameter $a$")
    ax.set_ylabel("Gini coefficient")
    plt.show()

The simulation shows that the fit is good.



A Model of Wealth Dynamics
==========================

Having discussed inequality measures, let us now turn to wealth dynamics.

The model we will study is

.. math::  
    :label: wealth_dynam_ah

    w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1} 

where

-  :math:`w_t` is wealth at time :math:`t` for a given household,
-  :math:`r_t` is the rate of return of financial assets,
-  :math:`y_t` is current non-financial (e.g., labor) income and
-  :math:`s(w_t)` is current wealth net of consumption

Letting :math:`\{z_t\}` be a correlated state process of the form

.. math::  z_{t+1} = a z_t + b + \sigma_z \epsilon_{t+1} 

we’ll assume that

.. math::  R_t := 1 + r_t = c_r \exp(z_t) + \exp(\mu_r + \sigma_r \xi_t) 

and

.. math::  y_t = c_y \exp(z_t) + \exp(\mu_y + \sigma_y \zeta_t) 

Here :math:`\{ (\epsilon_t, \xi_t, \zeta_t) \}` is IID and standard
normal in :math:`\mathbb R^3`.


.. math::  
    :label: sav_ah

    s(w) = s_0 w \cdot \mathbb 1\{w \geq \hat w\} 

where :math:`s_0` is a positive constant.


Implementation
==============

Here's some type information to help Numba.

.. code:: ipython3

    wealth_dynamics_data = [
        ('w_hat',  float64),    # savings parameter
        ('s_0',    float64),    # savings parameter
        ('c_y',    float64),    # labor income parameter
        ('μ_y',    float64),    # labor income paraemter
        ('σ_y',    float64),    # labor income parameter
        ('c_r',    float64),    # rate of return parameter
        ('μ_r',    float64),    # rate of return parameter
        ('σ_r',    float64),    # rate of return parameter
        ('a',      float64),    # aggregate shock parameter
        ('b',      float64),    # aggregate shock parameter
        ('σ_z',    float64),    # aggregate shock parameter
        ('z_mean', float64),    # mean of z process
        ('z_var', float64),     # variance of z process
        ('y_mean', float64),    # mean of y process
        ('R_mean', float64)     # mean of R process
    ]

Here's a class that stores instance data and implements methods that update
the aggregate state and household wealth.

.. code:: ipython3

    @jitclass(wealth_dynamics_data)
    class WealthDynamics:

            self.z_var = σ_z**2 / (1 - a**2)
            exp_z_mean = np.exp(self.z_mean + self.z_var / 2)
            self.R_mean = c_r * exp_z_mean + np.exp(μ_r + σ_r**2 / 2)

            if α >= 1:
                raise ValueError("Stability condition failed.")
                
        def parameters(self):

            """
            parameters = (self.w_hat, self.s_0,

                wp += R * s_0 * w 
            return wp, zp
            

Here's function to simulate the time series of wealth for in individual households.

.. code:: ipython3

    @njit
    def wealth_time_series(wdy, w_0, n):
        """
        Generate a single time series of length n for wealth given 
        initial value w_0.

        The initial persistent state z_0 for each household is drawn from

            * wdy: an instance of WealthDynamics
            * w_0: scalar
            * n: int


        """
        z = wdy.z_mean + np.sqrt(wdy.z_var) * np.random.randn()
        w = np.empty(n)
        w[0] = w_0
        for t in range(n-1):
            w[t+1], z = wdy.update_states(w[t], z)
        return w


Now here's function to simulate a cross section of households forward in time.

Note the use of parallelization to speed up computation.

.. code:: ipython3

    @njit(parallel=True)
    def update_cross_section(wdy, w_distribution, shift_length=500):
        """
        Shifts a cross-section of household forward in time

        * wdy: an instance of WealthDynamics
        * w_distribution: array_like, represents current cross-section
        
        Takes a current distribution of wealth values as w_distribution
        and updates each w_t in w_distribution to w_{t+j}, where 
        j = shift_length.  
        
        Returns the new distribution.

        """
        new_distribution = np.empty_like(w_distribution)
    
        # Update each household
        for i in prange(len(new_distribution)):
            z = wdy.z_mean + np.sqrt(wdy.z_var) * np.random.randn()
            w = w_distribution[i]
            for t in range(shift_length-1):
                w, z = wdy.update_states(w, z)
            new_distribution[i] = w
        return new_distribution
    
Parallelization is very effective in the function above because the time path
of each household can be calculated independently once the path for the
aggregate state is known.




Applications 
============

Let's try simulating the model at different parameter values and investigate
the implications for the wealth distribution.


Time Series
-----------

Let's look at the wealth dynamics of an individual household. 

.. code:: ipython3

    wdy = WealthDynamics()
    
    ts_length = 200
    w = wealth_time_series(wdy, wdy.y_mean, ts_length)
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(w)
    plt.show()

Notice the large spikes in wealth over time.

Such spikes are similar to what we observed in time series when :doc:`we studied Kesten processes <kesten_processes>`.



Inequality Measures
-------------------


Let's look at how inequality varies with returns on financial assets.

The next function generates a cross section and then computes the Lorenz
curve and Gini coefficient.

.. code:: ipython3

    def generate_lorenz_and_gini(wdy, num_households=100_000, T=500):
        """
        Generate the Lorenz curve data and gini coefficient corresponding to a 
        WealthDynamics mode by simulating num_households forward to time T.
        """
        ψ_0 = np.ones(num_households) * wdy.y_mean
        z_0 = wdy.z_mean
    
        ψ_star = update_cross_section(wdy, ψ_0, shift_length=T)
        return qe.gini_coefficient(ψ_star), qe.lorenz_curve(ψ_star)

Now we investigate how the Lorenz curves associated with the wealth distribution change as return to savings varies.

The code below plots Lorenz curves for three different values of :math:`\mu_r`. 

If you are running this yourself, note that it will take one or two minutes to execute.

This is unavoidable because we are executing a CPU intensive task.

In fact the code, which is JIT compiled and parallelized, runs extremely fast relative to the number of computations.

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    μ_r_vals = (0.0, 0.025, 0.05)
    gini_vals = []
    
    for μ_r in μ_r_vals:
        wdy = WealthDynamics(μ_r=μ_r)
        gv, (f_vals, l_vals) = generate_lorenz_and_gini(wdy)
        ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$\psi^*$ at $\mu_r = {μ_r:0.2}$')
        gini_vals.append(gv)
        
    ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
    ax.legend(loc="upper left")
    plt.show()

The Lorenz curve shifts downwards as returns on financial income rise, indicating a rise in inequality.


.. _htop_again:

.. figure:: htop_again.png
   :scale: 80


Now let's check the Gini coefficient. 

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()    
    ax.plot(μ_r_vals, gini_vals, label='gini coefficient')
    ax.set_xlabel("$\mu_r$")
    ax.legend()
    plt.show()

Once again, we see that inequality increases as returns on financial income
rise.

Let's finish this section by investigating what happens when we change the
volatility term :math:`\sigma_r` in financial returns.


.. code:: ipython3

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    σ_r_vals = (0.35, 0.45, 0.52)
    gini_vals = []
    
    for σ_r in σ_r_vals:
        wdy = WealthDynamics(σ_r=σ_r)
        gv, (f_vals, l_vals) = generate_lorenz_and_gini(wdy)
        ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$\psi^*$ at $\sigma_r = {σ_r:0.2}$')
        gini_vals.append(gv)
        
    ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
    ax.legend(loc="upper left")
    plt.show()


We see that greater volatility has the effect of increasing inequality in this model.
