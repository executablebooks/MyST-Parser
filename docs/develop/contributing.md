## Install for development

To install `myst-parser` for development, take the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser
cd MyST-Parser
git checkout master
pip install -e .[code_style,testing,rtd]
```

## Code Style

Code style is tested using [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org),
with the configuration set in `.flake8`,
and code formatted with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

Installing with `myst-parser[code_style]` makes the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
package available, which will ensure this style is met before commits are submitted, by reformatting the code
and testing for lint errors.
It can be setup by:

```shell
>> cd MyST-Parser
>> pre-commit install
```

Optionally you can run `black` and `flake8` separately:

```shell
>> black .
>> flake8 .
```

Editors like VS Code also have automatic code reformat utilities, which can adhere to this standard.

All functions and class methods should be annotated with types and include a docstring. The prefered docstring format is outlined in `MyST-Parser/docstring.fmt.mustache` and can be used automatically with the
[autodocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) VS Code extension.

## Testing

For code tests:

```shell
>> cd MyST-Parser
>> pytest
```

For documentation build tests:

```shell
>> cd MyST-Parser/docs
>> make clean
>> make html-strict
```

```{seealso}

```

## Pull Requests

To contribute, make Pull Requests to the `master` branch (this is the default branch). A PR can consist of one or multiple commits. Before you open a PR, make sure to clean up your commit history and create the commits that you think best divide up the total work as outlined above (use `git rebase` and `git commit --amend`). Ensure all commit messages clearly summarise the changes in the header and the problem that this commit is solving in the body.

Merging pull requests: There are three ways of 'merging' pull requests on GitHub:

- Squash and merge: take all commits, squash them into a single one and put it on top of the base branch.
    Choose this for pull requests that address a single issue and are well represented by a single commit.
    Make sure to clean the commit message (title & body)
- Rebase and merge: take all commits and 'recreate' them on top of the base branch. All commits will be recreated with new hashes.
    Choose this for pull requests that require more than a single commit.
    Examples: PRs that contain multiple commits with individually significant changes; PRs that have commits from different authors (squashing commits would remove attribution)
- Merge with merge commit: put all commits as they are on the base branch, with a merge commit on top
    Choose for collaborative PRs with many commits. Here, the merge commit provides actual benefits.
